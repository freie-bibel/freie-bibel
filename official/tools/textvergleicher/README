Description
-----------

textvergleicher is free software to generate HTML tables from Haggai
XML Bible Markup Language files for a comparison of bible translations.


Requirements
------------

A proper Java SDK must be installed to produce the *.class files.
The source code is compatible with Java 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7.


Installation
------------

Type

    make
    make install

in the directory containing the package's source code. By default, 'make install'
installs the textvergleich script in '/usr/local/bin/' and the textvergleicher
program files in '/usr/local/bin/textvergleicher/'. You may specify an
installation prefix other than '/usr/local/' by giving 'make' the option
'PREFIX'. Example:

    make install PREFIX=~/

would lead to following directory structure:

    ~/bin/                  <-- textvergleich script
    ~/bin/textvergleicher/  <-- textvergleicher program files

You may also set the /bin directory manually:

    make install BINDIR=~/my_bin/  <-- custom /bin


Execution
---------

Type

    java textvergleicher config-file

Either your working directory has to be 'BINDIR/textvergleicher/',
or the CLASSPATH environment variable must contain it.
Alternatively, you may use the textvergleich script in 'BINDIR'
instead.
