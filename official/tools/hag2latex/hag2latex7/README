Description
-----------

hag2latex7 is free software to generate LaTeX output from Haggai
XML Bible Markup Language files for typesetting a parallel bible.


Requirements
------------

A proper JDK [1] must be installed to produce the *.class files.
The source code is compatible with Java 1.5 and 1.6.


Build instructions
------------------

Either just type

    make

or, in case your build environment is missing "make", type

    javac ParallelProcessor.java
    javac hag2latex7.java

in the directory containing the package's source code. If you need to
cross-compile for a JRE [2] in a different version (check with

    java -version

on the target machine), type

    javac -source 1.6 -target 1.6 ParallelProcessor.java
    javac -source 1.6 -target 1.6 hag2latex7.java

where "1.6" should be the corresponding version number.


Execution
---------

Type

    java hag2latex7 haggai-file-left haggai-file-right latex-file-out



[1] JDK = Java Development Kit, i.e. http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html.
